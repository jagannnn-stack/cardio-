# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction ðŸ«€

This project predicts the risk of heart disease using machine learning models.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Data preprocessing & cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with plots
- Correlation heatmap
- Machine Learning models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, SVM
- Accuracy comparison of all models
- Final model saved (`heart_model.pkl`)

## ðŸ“Š Results
- Accuracy and metrics stored in `model_results.csv`
- Graphs available in `plots/`

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Cardio-Prediction.git
   cd Cardio-Prediction
